The main difference between the prototype and the screenshots are that:

    - In the prototype, the column for each dishes tends to be smaller and thinner. It also includes the timing of how long it's going to take as well as we need to have a feature where users can bookmark it. 

    - We do not have an add button yet. Therefore users cannot add different dishes they wanted. 

    - Dishes column tends to have a different layout. In the prototype, smaller dish image goes on the left with a simple description on the right. On the screenshot, the pictures are extremely large and therefore it is taking up most of the spaces.

    - On the receipe page, there are excess spaces that need to be taken care off. 

    - There is no prep time as well as the total time

    - On the top right, there is no comment button. 

Similarities:

    - Both of our prototype and screenshots both serve the purpose of telling users the intention of our app

    - Even though on the prototype, the columns are smaller for each dishes, however, we have the food and the description so it, allow users to navigate quickly.

    - Ingredients page successfully describe the ingredients, direction and nutrition facts. 

    - Have a menu bar, that users can go back and forth to whatever page. 

Overall, we do have most of the significant features in our application. However, we do need to update some parts and as well as update the visual aspect.
