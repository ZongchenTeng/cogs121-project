In milestone 4, we implemented real API data to provide a realistic view of our application. We chose the "market.mashape" API since it was a low-cost database with thousands of quality recipes with clear ingredients, instructions and high quality food photography which would elevate the experience of our web app. 

We also worked on creating designs for the screens before we begin frontend coding for the next milestone - https://www.figma.com/file/ChyjFeYzxHmQ1XzeI2f427D7/COGS-121-Reciprep 

We thought about the user's privacy when it comes to using our application and we would be handling user's data securely by using HTTPS.
