In milestone 4, we mainly improved on the visuality of our application. We implmented real API data to provide a realistic view of our application. 

We thought about the user's privacy when it comes to using our application, we will be handling user's data securely, we will be using HTTPS.

We chose the "market.mashape" API since it provided us the free food data API that we needed, as well as it also have clear insturctions and good looking pictures
