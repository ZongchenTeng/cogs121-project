Improvements since Milestone 4:

    - We decided to change the discover/homepage view to display only one card at a time instead of looking at a list of recipes which is a very standard UI. This not only helps the user focus on one recipe at a time but also makes our app stand out compared to other recipe apps. 

    - We added tinder-like buttons that allow the user to perform different actions on the recipe cards i.e skip, favorite and add to calendar

    - We also switched out our branding colors from the red to a more blueberry color because we noticed a lot of food-related apps were using red as their primary color and we wanted to stand out from those while still making the app feel like a food app. 

    - We also added a new screen i.e. when the user wishes to add a recipe to their calendar view, a modal pops up that displays the recipes they had favorited in the past. Clicking on a recipe then adds this recipe to the calendar view.
