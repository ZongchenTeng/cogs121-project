# Milestone 6

| ------------- | ------------- |
| New Calendar Page on the Swip System
On the homepage, users can swipe left to dismiss a recipe suggestion and right to view the next one and favorite. They can also click the calendar icon in the middle to choose "when and what meal" they should eat the dish that was projected on the homescreen. | ![alt text](https://github.com/quiquemz/cogs121-project/blob/master/milestone6_screenshots/new%20cal.jpeg "New Calendar") |

| New Ingredients Page
Now we have a new and better ingredients page. On the discover page, users will be greeted with the food picture, on the right bottom of the image, time of preparation following a question mark symbol. We have added the symbol to indicate the ingredients page. Users can click on the question mark, and it will locate them to the new ingredients page where they will entirely have access to the ingredients. | ![alt text](https://github.com/quiquemz/cogs121-project/blob/master/milestone6_screenshots/ingredients%20page.png "Ingredients Page") |

Improvements since Milestone 5:

    - We have added 2 new pages, both calendar and a new Ingredients page. Both pages are now working.

    - Now users can manually select the dates of the food they want to eat as well as which meal should they eat it with. Users can now simply swipe up on the discover page to do so. Similiarly to tinder's model "superlike"

    - We also fixed the ingredients page, now the ingredients pages are fully working. Users are now able to check both preperation time as well as the ingredients on the bottom right of the food picture in the discover screen.

    - Bugs Fixed
