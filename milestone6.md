# Milestone 6

| New Calendar Page on the Swip System
On the homepage, users can swipe left to dismiss a recipe suggestion and right to view the next one and favorite. They can also click the calendar icon in the middle to choose "when and what meal" they should eat the dish that was projected on the home screen. We presented a calendar bootstrap so that users can manually choose the date and the meals, and then this information will be stored in the calendar section in the sidebar section.| ![alt text](https://github.com/quiquemz/cogs121-project/blob/master/milestone6_screenshots/new%20calendar.png "New Calendar") |
| New Ingredients Page
Now we have a new and better ingredients page. On the discover page, users will be greeted with the food picture, on the right bottom of the image, time of preparation following a question mark symbol. We have added the symbol to indicate the ingredients page. Users can click on the question mark, and it will locate them to the new ingredients page where they will entirely have access to the ingredients. | ![alt text](https://github.com/quiquemz/cogs121-project/blob/master/milestone6_screenshots/ingredients%20page.png "Ingredients Page") |

Improvements since Milestone 5:

    - We have added two new pages, both calendar, and a new Ingredients page. Both pages are now working.

    - Users can just swipe up in the discover page to manually select the date and the meal they want to eat the food with. 
    Similarly to tinder's model "super like," this will allow users to have quick access to the calendar GUI without pulling from the sidebar.

    - We also fixed the ingredients page; now the ingredients pages are fully working. Users are now able to check both preparation time as well as the ingredients on the bottom right of the food picture on the discover screen. This will allow users to look at the food as well as have easy access to the recipes.

    - Visual update, as well as more bugs, decode. Consistent fonts and colors
