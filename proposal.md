**Ideas:**
 - We want to create a web application to help friends avoid discussions when choosing a film to go watch at the movies. We want to reduce the friction so that they can easily decide to go watch a specific  film and focus on enojoying it. The workflow of the app for the users would be: 1) login, 2) create/choose group of friends, and 3) choose a film. For the third step, the app would give suggestions based on previous preferences and geolocation. It would also provide the necessary information to help choose the best movie including trailers, ratings, and comments. Aditionally, it will provide a poll based on the friends' preferences. Hopefully, this app will help everyone have an awesome time at the movies.
